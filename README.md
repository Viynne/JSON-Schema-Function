# The JSON Schema Function

The Code found in this repository is intended to generate a schema from the example_schema provided.
The function reads directly from the json files in the 'data' folder, asserts the schema as provided in the instruction
'PROBLEM.md' and writes the output schema into the respective schema files found in the 'schema' folder.

## How to run the program

1. You need is python version 3.x to run this program.
2. Run the program in your terminal by running main.py file.

### Please Note
I provided a second function to solve this problem using a recursive method. This function is contained
in 'schema_.py'.
